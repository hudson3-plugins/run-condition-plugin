<j:jelly xmlns:j="jelly:core">
    <div>Run if the Expression matches the Label.
    <p>Both the Expression and the Label will be expanded with the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Token+Macro+Plugin" target="_blank">Token Macro Plugin</a>.<br />
        The Expression is a regular expression using the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html?java/util/regex/Pattern.html" target="_blank">Java syntax</a>.</p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <ol>
                <li>Parameterized publishing similar to the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Publish+Over+...#PublishOver...-Parameterizedpublishing" target="_blank">Publish Over</a> family of publishers.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Select &quot;This build is parameterized&quot; from the top of the job configuration, and add a String parameter</li>
                        <li>Enter $${ENV,var=&quot;PARAMETER_NAME&quot;} as the Expression</li>
                        <li>Give the publisher a Label e.g. UAT or RELEASE</li>
                        <li>Trigger a build passing in a regular expression as the value of PARAMETER_NAME e.g. INT|UAT</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Use a fixed regular expression to match against a property value in a property file that is generated during the build.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </div>
